{"name":"Build-desktop","tagline":"Build, install, and run scripts for the desktop build of Open webOS","body":"build-desktop\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe scripts in this repository are used to build, install, and run Open webOS on an Ubuntu Linux desktop computer.\r\n\r\nSupported platforms\r\n====================\r\n\r\n* Ubuntu Desktop 11.04 32-bit\r\n* Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n\r\nNote:  Builds on Ubuntu Server (or other non-desktop) installations are not currently supported (or working).\r\n\r\nHow to Build on Ubuntu Linux\r\n============================\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n  * Ensure you have a fast and reliable internet connection since you'll be downloading about 500MB\r\n\r\n  * Ensure you have at least 4GB of available disk space\r\n\r\n  * Install the following components needed to build (and run) Open webOS on the desktop by typing the following:\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install git git-core pkg-config make autoconf libtool g++ \\\r\n\t\ttcl unzip libyajl-dev libyajl1 qt4-qmake libsqlite3-dev curl\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install gperf bison libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev libxi-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibxrandr-dev libxfixes-dev libxcursor-dev libfreetype6-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev flex libicu-dev\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev liburiparser-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibc-ares-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev libdb4.8-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibcurl4-openssl-dev\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install xcb libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-sync0-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev \\\r\n\t\tlibxcb-icccm1-dev\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get build-dep qt4-qmake\r\n\r\n  * The components listed above are valid for both Ubuntu 11.04 and 12.04, except for libxcb-icccm1-dev which is libxcb-icccm4-dev on 12.04\r\n\r\n  * CMake version 2.8.7 will be fetched and used for the build; there is no need to install it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownloading\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nDownload the zip file and unzip it into an empty directory or better yet, \"git clone\" the repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding Open webOS\r\n-------------------\r\n \r\nChange to the folder where you downloaded the build-desktop scripts and run the build script:\r\n\r\n        $ ./build-webos-desktop.sh\r\n\r\nNote: This will typically take one to three hours, depending on the speed of your system and of your internet connection. The build will go much faster on a multi-core machine.  \r\nIf you experience build errors, try the following:  \r\n  * Verify you are on a compatible system\r\n  * Reapply the prerequisite components\r\n  * Run the build script with the clean parameter: \"./build-webos-desktop.sh clean\"\r\n\r\nInstalling Open webOS\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nChange to the folder where the build-desktop scripts are located (if necessary) and run the \"install\" script to create expected folders and symlinks into various system directories:\r\n\r\n        $ sudo ./install-webos-desktop.sh\r\n\r\nIn general, you should only have to run the install script once (unless you update to a newer version of the script).\r\n\r\nYou can run `sudo ./install-webos-desktop.sh remove` to remove the system folders and symlinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Run on Ubuntu Linux\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPlease note that this version of the build does not provide full runtime functionality.\r\n\r\n1) Change to the folder where the build-desktop scripts are located (if necessary).\r\n\r\n2) Start up the service bus:\r\n\r\n        $ ./service-bus.sh start\r\n\r\n  * The message `hub daemons started` indicates success. You can safely ignore error messages.  \r\n\r\n3) The first time you start, you'll need to create a default account:\r\n\r\n        $ ./service-bus.sh init\r\n  \r\n  * In order for the FileCache and Email to work properly, \"user_xattr\" attribute needs to be set on the filesystem where \"luna-desktop-binaries/staging\" is located. The command to set the attribute is given below.\r\n\r\n        $ sudo mount / -o remount,user_xattr\r\n\r\n  * Note that the above command will set the attribute temporarily on the filesystem, it will be reset to default settings when machine is rebooted. If you want to make it permenant, edit the file /etc/fstab to add the attribute. Please refer the Ubuntu documentation for more details.\r\n\r\n4) Start up the native webOS services on the service bus:\r\n\r\n        $ ./service-bus.sh services\r\n\r\n  * The message `Services started!` indicates success. You can safely ignore error messages.  \r\n\r\n5) Run luna-sysmgr  (ideally from a separate terminal shell window to keep the luna-sysmgr output separate from the service-bus logging)\r\n\r\n        $ ./run-luna-sysmgr.sh\r\n\r\n  * You can safely ignore the messages from LunaService.\r\n\r\n6) When you are finished running luna-sysmgr, stop the service bus:\r\n\r\n       $ ./service-bus.sh stop\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n  * Error messages are generated in the LunaService log output, which can be ignored.\r\n  * The email application may not work properly.\r\n\r\n# Copyright and License Information\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise specified, all content, including all source code files and\r\ndocumentation files in this repository are:\r\n\r\n Copyright (c) 2008-2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise specified or set forth in the NOTICE file, all content,\r\nincluding all source code files and documentation files in this repository are:\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this content except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
